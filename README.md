<h1>Flask-Blog-App</h1>

Working on a blog website that for example a company could use for their emplyoees. A user is able to register an account and create public blog posts.  User can update their account name as well as their profile picture.  User can also view all their posts.  I built this app to test out everything I've learned in Python and Flask so far, since both are new to me this is a good way to experiment as well.
